<h1>Login Form</h1>

This is a basic HTML application code for a login page.

The code consists of a form with two input fields for the user to enter their username and password, a "Forgot Password?" link and a Login button.

The form is contained within a div element with a class name of "login-card". The login card also contains a heading of "Login" and a subheading of "Enter Credentials".

The styles for this page are defined in an external CSS file, which is linked in the head section of the HTML code.

This code can be used as a starting point for a simple login page on a website or web application.
